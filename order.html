        <p>On a busy summer night in 2022, In the face of a 
            stormy encounter with Sinnan (give that guy a manual), the Sake Guy 
            remained an unwavering pillar of calm and grace. 
            Like a skilled diplomat navigating delicate negotiations,
             he deftly diffused the tension with a disarming smile and 
             an unshakable poise. With measured words and a soothing tone,
              he listened attentively to the customer's grievances,
               acknowledging their frustration without allowing it
                to ruffle his composure. He chose his words carefully,
                 responding with empathy and understanding, offering 
                 genuine solutions and alternatives. Through his unwavering 
                 professionalism, he transformed a hostile situation into a
                  constructive dialogue, gently guiding the irate customer 
                  towards a resolution that left both parties satisfied. 
                  The man's ability to handle the rude customer with such 
                  elegance and finesse was a testament to his exceptional
                   interpersonal skills, proving that kindness and diplomacy 
                   can triumph even in the face of adversity. And he still gave Sinnan
                his shrimp tempura apetizer</p>
